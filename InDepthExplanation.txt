Here is a more in-depth explanation of the source code from "main.py"

This project requires the use of three python modules; 'plyer', 'tkinter', and 'time'.

The 'plyer' module is used specifically for the 'notification' function, 
which is allows the notification signifying the end of the timer to be displayed as a desktop notification.

The 'tkinter' module is used for both the 'messagebox' and '*' functions.
'message box' is used to display prompts and message boxes for error messages
 '*' is used to the create the user interface for the application

The 'time' module is used to create a delay in between every second that passes.

Here is the code for mentioned in this section:
from plyer import notification
from tkinter import messagebox
from tkinter import *
import time

The next step in the project is to initialize the window and declare the dimensions.

window = Tk() Assigns the Tkinter class, Tk() to the object named 'window'

window.geometry("300x200") Specifies the length and breadth of the application

window.title("DataFlair - python Countdown timer and notification")

Now we have to define functions for the timer and for placeholders. Placeholders are optional, I put them as 0.

Here are the placeholder functions...

def h_click(event):
       
       hour_entry.delete(0, 'end')        

def m_click(event):
       
       min_entry.delete(0, 'end')

def s_click(event):         
 
 sec_entry.delete(0, 'end')
 
 
 Now to get into the main timer function
